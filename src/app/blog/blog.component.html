      <h2>Configuring .NET Applications with Kubernetes ConfigMaps: A Short Example</h2>

        <p>
          I wrote this blog post to distill my learnings on deploying, and managing, Kubernetes ConfigMaps to manage application configuration.
          This post is made to be more of an exercise, which includes a code demo, of how to set up a local k8 cluster, deploy a simple c# application to a Pod, and read in a ConfigMap.
          If this sounds interesting to you then by all means check this out!
